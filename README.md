# How to generate cactus distribution?

## cactus generators

There are two functions in this repo, cactus_generator.m and cactus_generator_monotonic.m. To generate the desired cactus distribution which given the best privacy performance under given cost constraints, you need to set configurations such as sensitivity, desired cost (l1 or l2), and quantization parameters, etc.. More details please refer to the comments within the code.
